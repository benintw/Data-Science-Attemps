# Data-Science-Project-Attempts


A repository for self-learning in Data Science 

### Topics I have done:
  - 1. Space Titanic (Kaggle)
  - 2. California Housing Prices (Kaggle)
  - 3. House Prices - Advanced Regression (Kaggle)


### Areas to improve on:
1. need to spend more time on:
  - understanding the data,
  - feature engineering,
  - filling missing values,
2. try to build pipelines
3. comment on the plots (dont just plot them)
