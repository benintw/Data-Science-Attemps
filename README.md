# Data-Science-Project-Attempts


A repository for self-learning in Data Science 

### Topics I have done:
  1. Space Titanic (Kaggle)
  2. California Housing Prices (Kaggle)
  3. House Prices - Advanced Regression (Kaggle)

### Topics I want to try:
   1. Concrete strength prediction
   2. Surface crack detection


### Areas to improve on:
1. need to spend more time on:
    - understanding the data,
    - feature engineering,
    - filling missing values,
2. try to build pipelines
3. comment on the plots (dont just plot them)
