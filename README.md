# Data-Science-Project-Attempts


A repository for self-learning in Data Science

### Topics I have done:
  - Space Titanic (Kaggle)
  - California Housing Prices (Kaggle)
  - House Prices - Advanced Regression (Kaggle)
  - Concrete strength prediction (Kaggle)

---
### Topics I want to try:

   - Surface crack detection (Kaggle - Image Classification)
   - Long-Term Asphalt Mixture Aging
   - Excavator Image Dataset | Construction Vehicle (Kaggle - Image Classification)
   - Pothole Severity Classification (Kaggle - Image Classification)

### Areas to improve on:
1. need to spend more time on:
    - understanding the data,
    - feature engineering,
    - filling missing values,
2. try to build pipelines
3. comment on the plots (dont just plot them)
