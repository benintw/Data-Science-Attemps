# Surface Crack Detection


## 1. Data Flow Preparation
  - use tf.keras.utils.image_from_directory()
  - split train_ds, val_ds, and test_ds
  
## 2. First try a simple (not too deep, not too wide) CNN

## 3. Implement Data Augmentation and try again

## 4. Add BatchNormalization() along with Data Augmentation, and try the model


---
## Findings:
- somehow, somehow the model in 2) performs the best ...
- need further investigations and research ...
- to be continued ...
